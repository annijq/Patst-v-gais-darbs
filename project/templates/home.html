<h1>Understanding Overconsumption</h1>

<div class="info-box">
    <p><strong>Overconsumption</strong> is the excessive consumption or use of goods and services (energy, land, water or materials) that cause harm or detrimental effects to humans and/or the environment, namely by exceeding the carrying capacity and life supporting systems of the planet and its ecosystems.</p>
    <p>It's a growing global concern that affects our environment, society, and future generations.</p>
</div>

<h2>The Problem at a Glance</h2>
<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="card">
        <h3>Resource Depletion</h3>
        <p>Many natural resources are being consumed faster than they can be replenished, including forests, fisheries, and freshwater sources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>Waste Generation</h3>
        <p>Growing consumption leads to more waste, much of which is not properly recycled or disposed of, leading to pollution.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>Climate Impact</h3>
        <p>Increased production and consumption of goods contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Ecological Footprint vs. Biocapacity</h2>
<p>The ecological footprint measures human demand on nature, comparing the resources people consume with the earth's ability to regenerate them.</p>

<div class="warning-box">
    <p>When ecological footprint exceeds biocapacity, it means we're using resources faster than they can be renewed, leading to environmental degradation.</p>
</div>

<h2>Key Facts About Overconsumption</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If everyone lived like the average American, we would need 5 Earths to sustain our resource use.</li>
    <li>About 1/3 of all food produced globally is wasted.</li>
    <li>The richest 10% of people are responsible for approximately 50% of global emissions.</li>
    <li>Since 1970, the global population has doubled, but resource extraction has tripled.</li>
    <li>Fast fashion leads to 92 million tons of textile waste annually.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Overconsumption is not just an environmental issue—it affects social equity, economic stability, and the well-being of future generations. 
Understanding our consumption patterns is the first step toward making positive changes.</p>
