<h2>Individual Actions That Make a Difference</h2>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="card">
        <h3>Mindful Consumption</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Before purchasing, ask: "Do I need this? Will I use it often?"</li>
            <li>Wait 24 hours before making non-essential purchases</li>
            <li>Choose quality over quantity</li>
            <li>Borrow or rent items you only need occasionally</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="card">
        <h3>Reduce Waste</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use reusable bags, bottles, and containers</li>
            <li>Compost food scraps</li>
            <li>Buy products with minimal packaging</li>
            <li>Repair items instead of replacing them</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Beyond Individual Actions</h2>
<p>While individual choices are important, systemic changes are also necessary to address overconsumption on a global scale:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Circular Economy:</strong> Supporting systems that minimize waste and maximize resource reuse</li>
    <li><strong>Policy Reform:</strong> Advocating for regulations that promote sustainable production and consumption</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Raising awareness about consumption impacts and sustainable alternatives</li>
    <li><strong>Community Initiatives:</strong> Participating in local sharing economies, repair cafes, and sustainability projects</li>
</ul>

<div class="success-box">
    <p>Remember: Every positive choice matters. Small changes by many people can lead to significant collective impact.</p>
